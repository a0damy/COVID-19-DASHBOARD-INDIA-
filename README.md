## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has been ravaging India, posing a significant threat to public health, economy, and social stability. The rapid spread of the virus has overwhelmed the country's healthcare infrastructure, and there is a pressing need for real-time insights into the pandemic's trajectory to inform effective mitigation strategies.

Specific Challenges include;
- Rapidly increasing case numbers and mortality rates
- Limited access to healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas
- Inadequate data availability and dissemination for effective decision-making
- Difficulty in tracking the virus's spread across different demographics, regions, and age groups.

## Objectives
Develop a data-driven solution to track the COVID-19 pandemic's trajectory in India, providing real-time insights into case numbers, mortality rates, hospitalizations, and vaccination efforts. The solution should enable policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public to make informed decisions and respond effectively to the crisis.
